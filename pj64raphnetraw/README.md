# pj64 input plugin with direct N64 controller access for raphnet adapters

This input plugin for project64 uses the direct controller access feature offered by raphnet N64 to USB
adapters (versions 3 and up) to let the emulated game communicate with the controllers directly.

* Perfect accuracy: The controller stick works exactly as it would on a N64 system, without any calibration or tweaking.
* Rumble Pak, Controller Pak (mempak), Transfer Pak and Bio sensor support.
* N64 Mouse support and VRU support.
* Low latency

And then to compile it:
```sh
cd ...somedir/hidapi
./bootstrap
